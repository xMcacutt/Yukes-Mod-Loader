# Yukes PS2 Mod Loader
![](Yukes%20Mod%20Loader/ModLoader.png)

A mod loader for mid 2000s DIP based Playstation 2 Yuke's games
to simplify and streamline the processes required for repackaging files into
a functional ISO.

This application comes in two forms, 

a command line tool which must be run
with valid arguments. This is completed and offers extraction and repacking of
DIPs and ISOs.

and a GUI which is in production and will allow for fast and efficient
access to creating and managing mods across multiple Yuke's games without
much modding or computer experience required.

For more details on the usage and functions of each tool, please
see the README in the relevant project directory listed above.
